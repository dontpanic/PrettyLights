CArduinoSerial::Connect requires a callback function. This function is in the following
format:

	bool CallbackFunction(const CString& strData);
	
Once CArduinoSerial::Connect is called, a thread is spawned that will listen to the
serial port and handle any incoming communication. This listener function will call
the supplied CallbackFunction with the data read off of the serial line as the 
strData parameter.
